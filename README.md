## Project Overview

The Digital Wallet allows users to:
1. Register and create a wallet.
2. Simulate a KYC check.
3. Perform various wallet operations such as loading funds, transferring money, and managing account settings.

---

## Features

The wallet service includes the following features:

### User Creation
- Allows users to register and create an account in the digital wallet system.

### Fake KYC Check
- Performs a simulated KYC (Know Your Customer) verification to verify the user.

### Wallet Operations
1. **Top-Up**:
    - Users can load money into their wallets via M-Pesa (simulated).

2. **Withdrawals and Transfers (P2P)**
    - Users can transfer funds from their wallets to other wallets, enabling peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions.

3. **Account Management**
    - Users have control over their wallet accounts with the ability to:
        - Request account statements.
        - Generate a QR code for easy wallet identification.
        - Set up and change a secure wallet PIN.
        - Enable or disable the wallet.
        - Permanently delete the wallet if no longer needed.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Java 21+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) or another compatible database

---

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/l00pinfinity/wallet.git
   cd wallet
   ```

2. **Configure Database**
    - Create a MySQL database for development (e.g., `wallet`).
    - Update the `application.yml` file with your database configuration.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

---

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Application**
   Run the application using the following command:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Access the API**
    - The application will start on `http://localhost:5000`.
    - Use Postman or another API testing tool to interact with the endpoints.

---

## Configuration

This project uses `application.yml` for configuration. Profile-specific configurations allow for environment-specific settings (development, production, etc.):

```yaml
# application.yml
spring:
  profiles:
    active: dev # Change to 'prod' for production
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/wallet-dev
    username: root
    password: your_password
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
    show-sql: true
```

You can add separate configurations for `prod` and `dev` profiles within the same `application.yml` file to manage different database and Hibernate settings.
